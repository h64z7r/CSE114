Instructions: Complete the steps below. Be sure to upload a copy of all your source code (.java) files to 
the link on Brightspace by its deadline, so that you can receive credit for this lab. 
 
1. If you know the balance and the annual percentage interest rate, you can compute the interest 
on the next monthly payment using the following formula: 
Write a program that reads the balance and the annual percentage interest rate and displays 
the interest for the next month. 
 
Here is a sample run: 
 
Enter balance and interest rate (e.g., 3 for 3 %): 1000 3.5 
The interest is 2.91667 
 
2. Write a program that prompts the user to enter two points,  and and displays 
their distance. The formula for computing the distance 
Here is a sample run: 
Enter x1 and y1: 1.5 -3.4 
Enter x2 and y2: 4 5 
The distance between the two points is 8.76413445842194 
 
3. The webcomic xkcd gives the following formula to approximate the United States population 
for a given year (from 2000 onward): 
 
 Obtain the last two digits of代 写CSE114、java
代做程序编程语言 the year (for example, 2017 would give you 17) 
 Subtract 10 from this value 
 Multiply the result by 3 
 Add 310 
 
 This gives the approximate U.S. population in millions of people. 
 
 Write a program (PopulationEstimates.java) that takes an integer representing a four-digit 
year as its single argument and prints an integer corresponding to the estimated U.S. 
population for that year in millions. CSE114: Introduction to Object Oriented Programming 
 
Here are some sample runs: 
Enter a year: 2021 
Population estimate (millions of people): 343 
 
Enter a year: 2030 
Population estimate (millions of people): 370 
 
Enter a year: 2050 
Population estimate (millions of people): 430 
 
Grading Guidelines: This lab is graded on a scale of 0-3 points, assigned as follows: 
 0 - The student did not attend the lab, 
 3 - The solutions are complete OR the student spent the entire lab solving the required lab problems 
(in this case, the students may not arrive at the lab after the lab started and may not leave until the 
lab ends).
